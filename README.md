## Project Story

### Inspiration
We were trying to remember a song from our childhood, but we only knew a few of the lyrics. We were gonna Shazam it, but we weren't near the song to record the audio. This made us think, what if we made an app that could find ANY song just from a few lyrics we remember?

### Challenges
- Implementing the "Accepted Thoughts" section with proper layout and design
- First-time integration with Spotify and Gemini APIs
- Creating an intuitive user interface for song discovery

### Accomplishments
- Successfully implemented the "Accepted Thoughts" section with a beautiful UI
- Integrated Spotify API for song details and previews
- Created an interactive chatbot for song discovery
- Built a responsive and user-friendly interface

### What's Next
- Optimize the song detection model
- Consider training a custom dataset for better lyric matching
- Explore pre-trained models on HuggingFace for improved accuracy
- Enhance the playlist generation capabilities
